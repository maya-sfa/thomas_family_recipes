1/4 C plus 1 Tbsp honey
12 bay leaves
3 large rosemary sprigs
1/2 bunch (14g) thyme
1/2 bunch (57g) flat-leaf parsley
1/2 cup garlic cloves, crushed, skin-on
2 Tbsp black peppercorns
1 C (140g) kosher salt
8 C water

Combine all the ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 1
minute, stirring to dissolve salt.

Remove from heat, and strain out solids.

Then, divide the brine into 1-Cup units. One unit will brine two pork
tenderloins (about two bounds of meat).

Freeze the brine and it will keep for at least six months.
