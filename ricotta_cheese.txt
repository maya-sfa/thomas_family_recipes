Begin with the whey output from cheese_curds.txt.

Set IP to 185F (uncovered), and heat to 170F. Add 1/2 tsp salt, mix in
quickly.

Set IP to 208F, and heat to 185F - 195F (in this range; exact temp
doesn't matter as long as it's about 184F and not boiling).

Add 3 Tbsp lemon juice and stir briskly.

The curds should begin to rise. As they rise, use a slotted spoon to
move them to the center.

Once the curds have finished forming, turn off the Instant Pot and let
them rest for 15 minutes.

Spoon them into a cheesecloth in a sieve or collander, and let drain
for 15 minutes - several hours (the more you let them drain, the drier
and more buttery the resultant product will be).

Then, use immediately or refrigerate.
