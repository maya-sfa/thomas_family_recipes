Dry Ingredients:
400 g cake flour
2 Tbp cocoa powder
1 tsp baking soda
Pinch of salt

Wet Ingredients:
1 stick unsalted butter, softened
330 g sugar
2 eggs, room temperature
1 C (250ml) vegetable oil (or try melted butter!)
1 tsp white vinegar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 C (250ml) buttermilk
2 1/2 Tbsp red food coloring liquid

Preheat oven to 350F. Butter 2 8" round cake pans (sides and base) and
dust with cocoa powder.

Sift the Dry Ingredients and whisk to combine in a bowl

Place butter and sugar in stand mixer bowl and beat with paddle mixer
until smooth and well-combined.

Add eggs, one at a time, beating in between to combine. At first it
will look curdled - keep beating until smooth

Add vegetable oil, vinegar, vanilla, buttermilk, and red food
coloring. Beat until combined and smooth.

Add Dry Ingredients. Beat until just combined - some small lumps are
OK, that's btter than over mixing

Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 25 - 30 minutes on the same
shelf, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Rest for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a cooling rack and
allow to cool.
