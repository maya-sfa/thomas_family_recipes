1 - 2 lbs small potatoes, halved or quartered
2 Tbsp avocado oil
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 Tbsp freshly chopped rosemary


Preheat oven to 425 degrees F

Add potatoes to a baking sheet and drizzle with avocado oil. The
potatoes should be coated but not soaking in oil. Then add salt,
pepper, and rosemary, and toss well to combine.

Roast until golden brown and crispy, about 30-35 minutes.
