Preheat oven to 375F. Place parchement on a baking sheet and set
aside.

Cut sliced white bread into crouton-shaped pieces, about one slice per
person being served.

Melt 1 Tbsp butter per bread slice.

Toss the bread in the melted butter, along with 1/4 tsp garlic powder
and 1/8 tsp salt per slice.

Spread evenly on the baking sheet and bake for 15 - 20 minutes.
