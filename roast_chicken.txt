Whole chicken
Fresh thyme
5 cloves garlic
5 Tbsp butter
Salt
Pepper
High-temperature oil
1 lbs small potatoes, skin-on
1 lbs carrots

Preheat a convection oven to 425F.

Scrub the potatoes. Peel the carrots, and cut into 2" lengths. Crush
the garlic cloves.

Remove the gizzards from the chicken. Into the cavity, place the thyme
and garlic.

Place the vegetables in a cast-iron skillet. Toss with the
high-temperature oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Place the bird on the vegetables, breast side up, and generously
season with salt and pepper. Place the butter on top of the breast,
sliced into individual tablespoons.

Roast at 425F until an internal temperature of 144F is reached
(generally about an hour and a half).

If you're roasting a smaller chicken, it may be done in fewer than 90
minutes. If so, remove the chicken from the vegetables, and keep
roasting those for the remainder of the 90 minutes, or until they are soft.

Remove from the oven and let rest for fifteen minutes.

Carve and serve immediately.
