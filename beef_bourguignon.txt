2 bay leaves, crumbled
1/2 tsp black peppercorns
4 - 4 1/4 lbs beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 2-inch chunks
Salt and ground black pepper
4 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
1/3 C all-purpose flour
4 C low-sodium beef broth
1 bottle (750ml) Pinot Noir or Burgundy

Onion and Mushroom Garnish:
36 frozen pearl onions
1 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 Tbsp sugar
Salt
3/4 C water
10 oz white mushrooms, whole if small, halved if medium, quartered if
                       large
2 Tbsp brandy
3 Tbsp minced fresh parsley leaves


1. For the braise: bring the salt pork, reserved pork rind, and 3 C
of water to boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Boil 2 minutes,
then drain well.

2. Cut two 22-inch lengths of cheesecloth. Wrap the parsley, thyme,
onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, peppercons, and blanched salt
pork rind in the cheesecloth and tie with butcher's twine to make a
boquet garni. Place boquet in a large Dutch oven. Preheat an oven to
300F.

3. Place diced salt pork in a skillet over medium heat. Saute
until lightly browned and crisp; about 12 minutes. Remove to a bowl
with a slotted spoon, and poor off and reserve most od the pork fat.
Pat the beef dry with paper towels and generously season with salt and
pepper. Use about 2 Tbsp of the reserved pork fat to brown half the
beef, turning once or twice, until deep brown, about 7 minutes. Remove
with a slotted spoon to the Dutch oven. Deglaze the pan with 1/2C of
broth, then pour the deglazing liquid into the Dutch oven. Repeat with
the remaining pork fat and beef, deglazing with another 1/2C of broth
before adding to the Dutch oven.

5. Add the butter to the now-empty skillet. When foaming subsides,
whisk in the flour until until evenly moistened and pasty. Cook,
whisking constantly, until the mixture has a toasty aroma and
resembles a light-colored peanut butter. Gradually whisk in the
remaining broth. Increase heat to medium high and bring to a simmer,
stirring frequently, until thickened. Pour mixture into the Dutch
oven. Add 3 C of wine, and salt and pepper to taste to
the Dutch oven and stir to combine. Set Dutch oven over high heat and
bring to a boil. Cover and place the pot in the oven. Cook until the
meat is tender, 2.5 - 3 hours.

6. Remove the Dutch oven from the oven and transter the boquet garniu
to a mesh strainer set over the pot. Press the liquid back into the
pot and discard the boquet. Remove the beef with a slotted
spoon. Allow the liquid to settle, and remove the fat. Bring the
liquid to a boil and. Simmer briskly, stirring occassionally to ensure
the bottom is not burning, until the sauce is reduced to about 3 cups
and thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, 15 to 25 minutes.

7. While the cause is reducing, bring the pearl onions, butter, sugar,
1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 C of the water to a boil in a medium skillet over
high heat. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmewr, shaking the
pan occassionally, until the onions are tender, about 5
minutes. Unover, increase the heat to high, and simmer until all of
the liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Ad the mushrooms and 1/4 tsp
salt. Cook, stirring occassionally, until the liquid released by the
mushrooms evaporates and the vegetables are browned and glazed, about
5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a large plate and set aside. Add
the remaining 1/4 C of water to the skillet and stir with a wooden
spoon to loosen the browned bits. When the pan bottom and sides are
clean, add the liquid to the reducing sauces.

8. When the sauce in the Dutch oven had reduced to about 3C and
thickened to the consistency of heacy cream, reduce the heat to
medium-low. Stir in the beef, mushrooms and onions (and any
accumulated juices), the remaining wine, and the brandy. Cover the bot
and cook until just heated through, 5 - 8 minutes. Adjust the
seasonings with salt and pepper to taste and serve, sprinkling thew
individual servings with the minced parsley.
