Sterilize the Instant Pot by filling it halfway with water and
runningon high pressure for twenty minutes. Release pressure, and dump
the water out.

Place 1 gallon of pastuerized whole milk into the IP (not
lactose-free!). Set the Ultra setting to 104F.

Once the milk achieves about 102F, add 1/4 tsp Calcium Chloride and
one packet of C201 Thermophilic Culture. Stir to combine, and
keep IP at 104F for 30 minutes.

Add 1/4 tsp liquid rennet to 30g cool water. Add this mixture the
milk, and stir the milk gently for 30 seconds.

In 18 - 25 minutes, a firm set should occur. Insert a small, sharp
knife horizontally and shallowly into the curd, and lift. The
resultant gap should fill with clear whey. If it is still cloudy,
continue to wait "a few minutes."

Cut the curd into 3/4" squares. Wait 3 minutes, then stir the
curds. As you stir, the curds will become smaller. Just stir for a few
seconds, until the curds are broken up.

Set the IP for 140F, and a timer for 30 (?) minutes. When the timer goes
off, the curds should be around 116F. Don't let them rise above
120F. Once they achieve 116F, cut the IP temperature to 124F to
maintain the temperature.

Continue to cook the curds for 30 - 60 minutes depending on
how dry you like them. [I say "(further?)" because I am unclear if the
original recipe includes the 30 minutes of the temperature rise in
that 30 - 60 minutes or not]

Transfer the curds to a cheesecloth-lined colander to drain. Gather
the cloth by its corners, and hang it to drain for 20 minutes. At the
end of twenty minutes, twist the cloth to press the curds
together. Place the resulting bag in a collander, place a small plate
on it, and place a gallon of water on top of the plate. Let set for "1
- 3 hours" [I will determine something more precise here].

Break the curd mass into bite sized pieces and toss with salt. Eat, or
store in the refrigerator in a Ziploc bag.
