Chicken Fingers:
2C flour
2C Pilsner beer
2 eggs beaten with 1/2 C water
3 lbs chicken tenders
1 tsp salt
Pepper
Peanut oil
Dill pickle spears

Spuds:
3 Russet potatoes, peeled and sliced about 1/4" thick

Honey horseradish dip:
Honey
Horseradish sauce

Place the peanut oil in a dutch oven and heat to 375F.

1. Beat the eggs and water together in a small bowl.

2. In shallow bowl, whisk together the 2C flour, salt, and pepper. Then,
add the beer and egg mixuture and stir to combine.

3. Dredge the chicken tenders in flour in the reserved flour,  and
then dip the tenders in batter. Deep fry the tenders until a deep
golden brown. Place them on a rack to drain and cool before eating.

If making the potatoes, do the same with them.

I recommend making the chicken first, then letting it rest in a warm
oven while you make the potatoes.

Serve with the dill pickle spears and honey horseradish dip (which is
just honey with horseradish added to taste; it should be cloudy and a
little spicy).

This is an attempt to replicate the chicken fingers from Spanky's
Pizza Gallery and Saloon in Savannah, GA, from my youth. They were the
first chicken fingers I'd ever had, not long after we moved there in
1977. I (much later) found out that they literally invented chicken
fingers in 1976, so I was unknowingly one of the first people to fall
in love with this! Please note that at the time of writing this it's
been about fifteen years since I had any so I have no idea how
accurate it is.
