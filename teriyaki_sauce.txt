20090328: The substitutions below (regular soy sauce and mirin) seemed
good. I actually put in maybe double the ginger (4 tsp), and simmered
it for about two more minutes (7, total). It had a nice little spicy
undertone.

1/3 cup light soy sauce (20090328: Tried 1/4 C regular soy sauce)
2/3 cup sake
5 cloves garlic, smashed
2 inches of fresh ginger, sliced thin, or 1 tsp dried
Juice of 1/2 lemon

1/2 cup mirin (subst: 1/2 cup sake + 1/3 cup sugar (or 1/4 C agave syrup))
1 Tbsp cornstarch

Mix together the soy sauce, 2/3 C sake, garlic, ginger and lemon
juice in a small saucepan. If substituting for mirin, add the sugar
as well and reserve the 1/2 C sake; otherwise, just reserve the mirin.

Simmer for 5 minutes.

While simmering, mix the cornstarch with the 1/2 cup of mirin or sake.

When mixture is done simmering, strain the solid parts out, then return
to heat, and return to a low boil. Add cornstarch, and simmer until
thick. Ideally, cool before using (20 min in freezer should bring it
to room temperature).

For a "sweet and sour" sauce, hold lemon juice, double it, and add it
after straining.
