Elements of Pizza Version: (69.8% hydration)
One Neapolitan ball, multiply times number of balls you wish to make:

116 grams 90 - 95 degrees F water
4g fine sea salt
.5 g instant dried yeast
166 g 00 white flour

Measure water into 6-quart dough tub. Add salt, and swish until it’s
dissolved. Add yeast, wait one minute for it to hydrate, then swish
around until incorporated. Add flour.

Mix by hand until combined, and pinch-knead for 1 minute. The target
dough temperature should be 80F.

Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, then knead on a work surface with
a very light dusting of flour for 1 minute. The skin of the dough
ball should be very smooth. Place the dough ball seam-side down in the
lightly oiled dough tub. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, and hold at
room temperature for 2 hours (assuming ambient temperature is 70 - 74F)
for the first rise.  Divide the dough and shape it into balls. Moderately
flour a work surface. With floured hands, gently ease the dough out of the
tub. Dust the entire top of the dough with flour, then cut it into the
requisite number of pieces (one per intended pizza). Shape each piece
of dough into a medium-tight round, working gently and being careful
not to tear the dough.

Put the dough balls on lightly floured dinner plates, leaving space
between them for expansion. Lightly flour the tops, tightly cover with
plastic wrap, and put in the refrigerator. Refrigerate until ready to make
pizza, ideally about 24 hours.  Remove dough balls from the refrigerator
60 - 90 minutes before making pizza.
