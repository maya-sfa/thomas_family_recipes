1 lbs ground beef, any fat percentage
1 lbs ground bison or venison
28 oz canned chopped tomatoes
16 oz dried kidney
1 medium white onion, chopped
12 garlic cloves, minced
3 Tbsp chili powder
1 Hershey's chocolate bar
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp msg
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 1/2 tsp cayenne
1 can Guiness Beer
2C Beef Stock, Low Sodium

Brown the beef and game meat together in a skillet until the fat is
rendered. Drain the fat off and discard (or save for another use).

Then, dump everything in the slow cooker, cover, and cook on low for 8
hours (or high for 6).
