2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
1 medium onion, sliced
2 cinnamon sticks
4 green cardamom pods
4-5 cloves
3-4 whole peppercorns
2 bay leaves
2 tsps coriander powder
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp cayenne powder
1/2 tsp Garam Masala
1 1/2 tsps salt, or to taste
7 cloves garlic, minced (or smashed)
1 tsp cumin powder (or 1 Tbsp fresh peeled and chopped)
1 Tbsp fresh gingner, peeled and chopped
1/2 C raisins
13.5 oz coconut milk

2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Put everything but cilantro in the slow cooker, and cook 8 hours on
low or 5 hours on high (and with this recipe it doesn't really matter
what your choice is).

At the end of the cook, shred the chicken into the sauce with a
spoon. Top with chopped cilantro. Serve with rice.
