Dough:
350g 95F water
8g instant yeast
1 Tbsp white sugar
630g all-purpose flour
8g salt
1/4 cup oil (or 4 Tbsp melted butter)

Wash:
1 egg
1 Tbsp of water

1 Tbsp caraway seeds (optional)

Place the warm water, sugar, and yeast in a mixing bowl. Let stand
until foamy, about 5 - 10 minutes.

Add the flour, salt, and oil, and mix with bread hook to
combine. Knead on medium for four minutes.

Remove the bread hook, form the dough into a ball, return to the
mixing bowl and cover with a towel until doubled in size, about 90
minutes.

Preheat an oven to 350F.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, gently deflate it,
and divide into eight pieces.

Roll each ball with a rolling pin until it is an oval about six inches
long and 1/2 inch thick. Use a knife to cut three parallel lines on
the top of each loaf, cutting perpandicular to its long axis. Place
each loaf on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

Mix together egg and Tbspn water, and brush over the top of the
loaves. If using caraway seeds, sprinkle on the loaves.

Bake for 20 - 25 minutes in preheated oven until loaves are shiny and
brown.
