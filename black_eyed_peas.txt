Add a small amount of chicken stock to the pot, and scrape the bottom

stock is boiling. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring
occassionally, until it thickens up, 30 - 40 minutes.

Old (pre-2018) recipe:

1 lbs pork shoulder

1/2 onion, diced
12 cloves garlic, minced
2 stalks celery, diced
2 carrots, diced
16 oz dried black eyed peas, soaked overnight in cold water and
   drained
4 cups (32 oz) chicken stock
4 cups water
Dash of cumin
Ground Red Pepper
2 bay leaves
28 oz diced tomatoes

Cooked just pork and mirepoix with garlic and spices after browning the
pork shoulder. Cooked for 1 hour at 275, then put in black eyed peas
and cooked for 1 hour. Beans were overdone. Pork was perfect.

Hamhocks are a bad idea, they give it a bad flavor.  8 Cups of liquid
was way too much - 4 would probably be fine

I think for next year (2014):

Cook meat and mirepoix with garlic and spices for 90 minutes. Put beans
in for 30. Then, figure out what to do with the tomatoes. One 28 oz can
might not be enough.
