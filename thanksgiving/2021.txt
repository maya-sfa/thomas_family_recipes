Updated order with when I actually made things.

Next year, can make Mac & Cheese, Stuffing, and Green Bean Casserole
the day before.

On the stuffing, if you halve the recipe, don't put it in too big a pan
- it wants a small (9" x 12") pan so it'll be deep enough not to
overcook.

Do NOT start the green beans and the creamed onions at the same
time. The green beans will be done in about ten minutes and the onions
want about twenty-five.

Roast Turkey au jus
