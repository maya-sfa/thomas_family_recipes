Last minute freak-out was too long. Burned the stuffing while I was
focusing on other things; I always forget that when you're running all
four burners at the same time the max output is way down and things
take a lot longer.

I roasted the turkey starting at 0800 Thursday and it was handily done
in time, I think it was about four hours.

For 2022, I'm thinking we lose the fresh green beans entirely. The
final dishes that we need to do at the last minute are creamed onions
and braised brussel sprouts, both of which are easy. Also, make a full
batch of stuffing to make Lauren happy.
