After-Action Report:
- Turkey cooked too slow (will update Turkey recipe to increase temperature)
- Double creamed onions took a loooong time to cook. Need start earlier.
- We could do the stuffing Wednesday and just warm it up with the
  green bean casserole
- Don't use cling wrap to cover the pumpkin pie
- Turkey roasting recipe needs a complete update - it's my original
  notes plus a bunch of past years' revisions on top, and it's
  confusing in the heat of the moment
