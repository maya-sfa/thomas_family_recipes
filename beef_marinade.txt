1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons brown sugar
4 anchovy filets (or 1 Tbsp fish sauce)
2 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons chopped chives
1 medium shallot, sliced
1 whole flank steak, about 2 pounds (see note)

Put it all in the blender cup, hit with stick blender.

Reserve 1/3C to serve as sauce with steak, and put steak in a vacuum
bag with the marinade and seal it. Let it marinade for at least an
hour (or sous vide with it).

1 cup red wine
3/4 cup conola oil
Juice of two lemons
1 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
5 garlic cloves
pressed 1/2 onion
diced 1 Tbsp rosemary

Not enough flavor. Â Needed more wine, more garlic...maybe rework as a
variant of the tequila-lime but make it red-wine and lemon?
