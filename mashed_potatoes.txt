2 lbs Yukon Gold (or Russet) potatoes, scrubbed
8 Tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
1 C cream, warmed (unwarmed was fine)
1 1/2 tsp salt
Ground white pepper

Two ways to cook the potatoes. First, if you wish to boil them:

Place potatoes in a large saucepan with cold water to cover by about
1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and
simmer until the potatoes are just tender when pricked with a thin-bladed
knife, 20 - 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes.

Secondly, if you wish to roast them (recommended):

Preheat an oven to 400F. Pierce the skins of each potatoes a few times
with a fork. Place them on a baking sheet, and bake until very tender,
about 60 minutes. You may find it easier in this case to remove the
skins from the potatoes before you put them in the ricer.

In order to save your fingers, you may let cool for about 20 - 30
minutes before continuing, but it's not necessary.

Set a ricer over the now-empty but still-warm saucepan (or a bowl if
you roasted the potatoes). Cut each potato in half (skin-on) and place
in the ricer, cut-side down. Press down the ricer, and the potato will
be forced out, leaving behind the half-skin to be discarded. Repeat
for all halves and potatoes.

Stir in the melted butter with a wooden spoon until incorporated. Gently
whisk in the half-and-half, salt, and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

Variation: May also add previously-roasted garlic cloves to the ricer
with the potatoes for garlic mashed potatoes.
