Modernist:

265g water
11g sodium citrate
285g shredded cheese - favorite: 214 g Cheddar 71 g Gruyere

240g dry pasta - any will probably do, but small noodles will be
best. Macaroni is obviously traditional, but I prefer Cavatappi for a
little exta fanciness.

Cook the pasta according to its instructions, and drain. While the
water is boiling and you're coooking the pasta, make the cheese sauce
as follows:

Add the water to a small saucepan, and bring it to a simmer. Add the
sodium citrate, and use an immersion blender to mix it with the
water. Then, add cheese a handful at a time, blending with an
until smooth with each handful. After all cheese is added, bring to a
light simmer for five minutes.

Place the pasta in a casserole dish, pour the cheese sauce over it,
and toss to combine.

Can be made ahead and reheated in an oven (probably 350F for 15
minutes or so). May be topped with bread crumbs; if so, wait until
you're reheating it, and regardless, toast it under a broiler until
they're golden brown.

20121226 - this is way too much for four people (especially two of them
picky). Halve it next year, maybe only make a third.


32 oz Macaroni
1 1/2 lbs (24 oz) grated cheddar
8 oz grated jack cheese
16 oz sour cream
12 cloves garlic
2 pieces of bread, toasted, buttered and crumbed

Begin to cook the macroni, and then continue on the other tasks. If
it finishes, simply drain it, toss in a little butter (to lubricate it),
toss it, and set it aside in a caserole dish or dishes.

Grate all the cheese.

Chop the garlic. Saute the garlic in butter, set aside.

Put one of the sour cream containers in a saucepan, over the lowest
heat possible. Once it warms up, slowly begin adding the grated
cheese. Keep it moving in the pan to keep it from burning to the bottom
of the pan. As it thickens up, add the second tub of sour cream. When
all the cheese is melted, pour it over the macaroni.

Toast 2 slices of bread. Fit them into the handy chopper and chop
'em to make 1C of bread crumbs, and spread over about half the mac and
cheese. If you're doing all bread crumbs, use 4 pieces.

Place caseroles in the oven and broil for 10 minutes or until the top
is just beginning to brown.

Notes, 12/26/06:


Above recipe was written 12/25/05.


I've updated the garlic to "6 cloves". We might've used a little more,
but that was perfect. I put all the above-breadcrumbs on the little
casserole (by mistake) and it was too much. I think probably half the
above amount, and just put it on one casserole.

The above-described sour cream:cheese ratio was a bit large. Also,
I think the pasta:sauce ratio was small. Next year I'm thinking only
one package of sour cream, and 32oz of pasta.


Also, it took more like 35 minutes at 350 to brown it.

Notes, 12/25/07:

The '06 notes are all spot on - did 16oz of sour cream, and 2 pieces
of toast for breadcrumbs. Big change this year was broiler browning -
took less than 10 minutes in the oven.

Next year, should half the recipe if we only get the Sohns for
dinner. Used exactly 2 lbs of cheese and 2lbs of macaroni, which was the
exact right mixture. Probably could've used more garlic. Also, saved a
pan by browning the garlic in the bottom of the saucepan before beginning.

I've updated the above recipe to these notes; it is probably "final".
