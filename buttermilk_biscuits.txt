Yield: One dozen Biscuits

2 cups (240 grams) all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter, COLD
2 tablespoons shortening
1 cup buttermilk, chilled

Preheat oven to 450 degrees

Cut the butter into 1/4" chunks.

Place the flour, baking soda and baking powder in the food processor
and pulse to combine.

Add the shortening and butter, and pulse in one-second pulses to combine
until it looks crumby.

Pour this mixture into a bowl, make a well in the center, and add the
buttermilk. Stir until just combined; it will be very sticky.

Turn this dough out onto a well-floured surface and dust the top with
flour. Fold over on itself five or six times. Press into a one-inch
thick round.

Cut biscuits with a two-inch cutter, and place on a cookie sheet with
a silicone sheet on it so they just touch.

Reform the scrap left over and cut the rest of those into biscuits as
well. These more-worked biscuits will be less tender, but, as Alton
Brown says, "that's life".

Bake until biscuits are light and gold on top, 15 - 20 minutes.

Note: The flour weight is assuming King Arthur All Purpose Flour
