New New:
2 Tbsp butter
1/2 med. yellow onion, sliced
7 cloves garlic, minced
3 Tbsp curry powder
1 tsp ground ginger (or some fresh)
2 tsp salt
2 C coconut milk
1/2 C raisins
2 Thai chilis, sliced thin, with seeds (optional).
Meat and/or vegetables for curry, cut into bite-sized pieces. May be
pre-cooked or raw (great way to use up leftovers!)

Melt the butter over medium heat in a dutch oven. Add the onions and
chilis (if using), and saute until onions are translucent, about 8
minutes. Add garlic, and cook until  fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add the curry powder, ginger, and salt, and stir.

Slowly add the coconut milk, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil,
and then simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.

If adding raw food (like chicken chunks), add after fifteen
minutes. If adding pre-cooked food, add it as you remove the sauce
from heat.

After removing from heat, cover the pot and let set for 30 minutes to
let flavors combine. Reheat to warm (if needed) and serve.
