4 large sweet potatoes
1/2 C packed dark brown sugar
8 Tbsp (1 stick) butter, melted
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1/2 C milk
2 large eggs
1/2 tsp kosher salt
2 1/2 C mini marshmallows

Preheat oven to 350F. Poke holes in potatoes with a fork. Bake for one
hour or until soft. Leave oven on at 350F, or turn it off and preheat
it again before final step.

Allow potatoes to cool (simply so they'll be easier to work with).

Cut the potatoes open and scoop the insides out. In a large bowl,
either mash them, or rice them. Mix together sweet potatoes, sugar,
butter, vanilla, milk, eggs, and salt until smooth.

Grease a 9x13" baking dish with cooking spray. Pour the mixture into
the prepared dish. Top with marshmallows, and bake until cooked
through and golded, about 30 minutes.
