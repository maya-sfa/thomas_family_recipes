3 cups (361g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon sugar
6 tablespoons (85g) butter, at room temperature
1 to 1 (227g) cold milk or buttermilk
  (use whole milk for the most tender biscuits)*
For the buttermilk, you may substitute 1 Tbsp vinegar + 1 Cup - 1 Tbsp of milk.

Preheat your oven to 425Â°F with a rack in the upper portion. Place a
Silpat on a baking sheet.

Place the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar in a food
processor. Run for five seconds to combine.

Drop the butter into the food processor one Tbsp at a time. As you put
each in, pulse to combine until there are no obvious butter chunks.

Continue to pulse the food processor until you have a crumbly mixture
resembling breadcrumbs.

Pour the smaller amount of milk in, and run the food processor utnil
you've made a cohesive dough, but no longer than 15 seconds. If it
doesn't come together, add up to 2 Tbsp (28g) more milk to get it to
come together.

Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Pat it into a rough
rectangle about 3/4" thick. Fold it into thirds like a letter and roll
gently with a floured rolling pin until the dough is 3/4" thick again.

Cut the dough into circles with a biscuit cutter for traditional round
biscuits; a 2 3/8" cutter makes nice-sized biscuits. Or to avoid
leftover dough scraps, cut the dough into squares or diamonds with a
bench knife or sharp knife.

Place the biscuits bottom side up on your prepared baking sheet;
turning them over like this yields biscuits with nice, smooth
tops. Brush the biscuits with milk, to enhance browning.

Bake the biscuits for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're lightly
browned. Remove them from the oven, and serve warm.

Store any leftover biscuits, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage. Biscuits are always best when they're rewarmed before serving.
