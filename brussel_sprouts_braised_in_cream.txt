1 lbs small Brussels sprouts, stem end trimmed and discolored leaves
removed

1 C heavy cream
1/2 tsp salt
Freshly grated nutmeg
Ground black pepper

Bring the sprouts, cream and salt to a boil in a two-quart saucepan
over medium-high heat. Cover and simmer, shaking the pan once or twice
to prevent sticking. Cook until a sharp knife tip inserted into the
center of a sprout meets no resistance, 10 - 12 minutes.

Season with nutmeg and pepper to taste. Serve immediately. May be kept
warm in a slow cooker.
