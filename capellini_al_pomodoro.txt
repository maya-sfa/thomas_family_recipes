1/2 pound of cappellini or angel hair pasta

Olive oil
8 cloves garlic
1/2 small yellow onion
2 large fresh tomatoes
1 Tbsp dried oregano, or 1 tsp fresh oregano, chopped
12 leaves fresh basil

Heat olive oil in a skillet.  Chop the onion; add to heated oil and
saute until translucent.  While sauteing, put water on to boil; mince
the garlic, seed and chop the tomato, and chop the basil.  When the
onion is ready, add the garlic to the skillet and cook for one minute.
Add the tomato and oregano, and cook for ~ten minutes.  In the midst
of all this, when the water is ready, add the pasta to it.

When the pasta is ready, drain it. Remove the skillet from the heat,
and add the bail, and salt and pepper to taste. Top the pasta with
the sauce you just made, and serve.
