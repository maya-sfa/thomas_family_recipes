1 lbs (454g) bulk breakfast sausage
1/3 C (40g) all-purpose flour
3 - 4 C whole milk, or more to taste
1/2 tsp salt
Black pepper

Make the biscuits from biscuits.txt. Once you put them in the oven,
begin to work on the sausage gravy.

In a cast-iron skillet, or nonstick pan, brown and break up the
sausage. Sprinkle half the flour into the skillet until the sausage
and rendered fat soak it up, then add a the remainder a little at a
time until it's all incorporated. Cook for one minute.

Cook, stirring frequently, until the gravy begins to thicken, about 11
minutes. Add the salt and pepper. If it over-thickens, add more milk,
this is an art, not a science.

Spoon the gravy over the biscuits and serve immediately!
