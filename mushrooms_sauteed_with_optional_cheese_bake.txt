10 oz cremini (baby bella) mushrooms, sliced (1 package pre-sliced is
perfect)
3 Tbsp butter
7 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 sweet white onion, chopped
3 Tbsp soy sauce

If baking with cheese:
250g shredded cheese; 50/50 Cheddar/Gruyere recommended

If baking, preheat an oven to 400F, and use an oven-safe cast-iron or
nonstick skillet for the following:

Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Melt butter in the skillet,
then add the onions and sweat until translucent, about 7 minutes. Add
the garlic, and cook until fragrent, about 30 seconds. Add the
mushrooms and toss in the pan to coat with the remaining butter in the
pan.

Continue heating, stirring occasionally until the mushrooms begin to
release their water, about five minutes. Once the water is released,
add the soy sauce, and increase heat to high until the water is
completely boiled off, stirring the mushrooms occassionally.

Once the mushrooms have begun to dry out, stir frequently until they
are browned. If not baking, serve immediately.

If baking, cover with shredded cheese, and place in the oven until
cheese is melted. Optionally place under broiler for 2 - 3 minutes
until cheese browns. Let cheese set up for five minutes before
serving.
