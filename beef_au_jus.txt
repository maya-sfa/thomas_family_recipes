4 Tbsp butter or beef drippings
2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (or Wondra!)
1/4 C dry red wine
2 C beef broth
1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp MSG
1 tsp salt (plus more to taste)
Freshly ground pepper

Separately: Beef you'd like to dip in this

Melt the butter or fat in a small saucepan. Sprinkle in flour and
whisk until a paste forms. Cook until this paste becomes light brown
color.

Slowly add the beef broth, whisking constantly as you do. As soon as
the broth is fully incorporated (it no longer looks like a paste), you
may whisk less vigorously as you add the remaing broth. Then add the
wine, Worcestershire sauce, and MSG.

Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes.

Add freshly ground pepper.

Taste and add additionnal salt and pepper if needed.
