Pizza:
Toppings
1 lbs shredded cheese
Skillet marinara sauce with 2 Tbsp extra sugar and 5 minutes extra
cook time

Pizza Dough:
390g all-purpose flour
1/2 C (85g) yellow cornmeal
7 grams yeast
2 teaspoons granulated white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
295g warm water
3 tablespoons unsalted butter (melted and cooled slightly, for dough)
4 tablespoons unsalted butter (at room temperature, for dough later)
3 tablespoons unsalted butter (greasing skillet)

1. Melt 3 Tbsp unsalted butter in a 12 inch cast iron skillet.

2. Remove 4 Tbsp unsalted butter from refrigerator and set aside.

3. In a mixing bowl, measure warm water and yeast. Allow a few minutes
to awaken the yeast.

4. Add the flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and 3 Tbsp melted butter to
the mixing bowl.

5. Mix on low speed with a dough hook for 1 - 2 minutes until the
dough comes together. Then, increase speed to medium and knead for 4-5
minutes, until dough ball is smooth and shiny and pulls away from the
sides of the bowl.

6. Coat the sides and bottom of the dough tub (or bowl you can cover)
with olive oil, and your hands as well. Transfer dough to tub and let
rest at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour.

7. Make skillet marinara sauce with 2 Tbsp extra sugar and cooking it
for five extra minutes.

8. Pre-heat the oven to 425 degrees.

9. Turn the dough out onto a clean countertop. Roll the dough into a
15 by 12-inch rectangle. Using an off-set spatula, spread the softened
butter over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border along the
edges. Starting at the short end, tightly roll the dough into a
cyclinder. With the seam-side down, flatten the dough into a 18 by
4-inch rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds like a business
letter. Pinch the seams together to form a ball. Repeat with the
remaining dough and transfer the balls to the oiled bowl. Cover
tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in the refrigerator until
nearly double in size, 45 to 50 minutes.

10. Melt remaining 3 Tbsp butter in the cast iron skillet.

11. Roll the dough ball into a 15-inch round disk about 1/4 inch
thick. Place it in the cast iron skillet, working it into the corners
and up the sides.

12. Top with, in order, 1 pound of shredded cheese, toppings, and
marinara sauce.

13. Bake until the crust is golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove
from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
