1 recipie Pie Dough for Prebaked Pie Shell

6 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 C packed dark brown sugar
1/2 tsp salt
3 large eggs
3/4 C light corn syrup
1 Tbsp vanilla extract
2 C pecans, toasted and chopped into small pieces (to toast, bake at
350F for 10 minutes)

Pre-heat an oven to 375F if not making the pie shell recipe (if you
are, do that first and the oven will be at 375F when you're done).

Melt the butter in a medium heatproof bowl set in a skillet of water
mainted at just below a simmer. Remove the bowl from the skillet; stir
in the brown sugar and salt with a wooden spoon until the butter is
absorbed. Beat in the eggs, then the corn syrup and vanilla. Return
the bowl the hot water; stir until the mixture is shiny and hot to the
touch, about 130 degrees F. Remove from the heat; stir in the pecans.

Lower the oven temperature to 275F. Pour the pecan mixture into the
pie sheel. Bake on the middle rack until the pie looks set and yet
soft, like gelatin, when gently pressed with the back of a spoon, 50
to 60 minutes. Transfer the pie to a rack; cool completely, at least 4
hours.

To re-warm for serving, place in a 250F oven for about 15 minutes.
