4 lbs pork loin roast
2 lbs sauerkraut, drained
2 Tbsp high-temperature neutral oil
4 Tbsp butter
1 large onion, thinly sliced
2 Tbsp packed brown sugar
2C 16oz flavorful beer (see Beer Note, below)
2 large tart apples, thinly sliced
2 tsp caraway seeds
Salt
Pepper

Preheat oven to 350F.

Season pork liberaly with salt and pepper.

Place a large dutch oven over medium-high heat. When hot, add neutral
oil and heat until shimmering. Add pork and sear on all sides until
golden brown all over, about 8 minutes. Set aside.

Reduce heat to medium, and melt butter in dutch oven. Add onion and
apples, stirring frequently until starting to soften, about 4
minutes. Stir in sauerkraut, brown sugar, beer, and caraway
seeds. Bring mixture to a simmer, then place seared pork on top.

Cover pot, then transfer to oven and bake until pork reaches interal
temperature of 135F, about 60 minutes.

Remove from oven. Place the pork roast on a platter and cover loosely
with foil and allow to rest for at lest fifteen and no more then 30
minutes.

While the pork rests, place the pot on the stovetop and boil uncovered
over high heat until the liquid has reduced to a thicker sauce, about
fifteen minutes.

Carve the roast and serve with sauerkraut.

Beer Note:
When I first made this, I used the 2021 Anchor Steam Holiday Ale. Any
strong ale will be ideal, but I imagine almost any beer would work
very well (though perhaps avoid bitter beers as the reduction step
will enhance that flavor).
